# MultiLang-PrimeFinder

I was curious to see how the performance of a similar program varies depending on the language it is written in.

To give me a good benchmark of the performance of various programming languages, I wrote a very basic prime number finder that will find all prime numbers up to 100,000.

### Performance Charts
I ran each of the programs on a Ryzen 7 3800x processor, and got the following average results:

1) Java: 13ms
2) C: 67ms
3) Python: 273ms

There must be some major optimization I'm missing for the python code, as it is <b>SIGNIFICANTLY</b> slower than the alternatives.
